  <h2>College</h2>
  <p>One of the reasons that I chose this university is because it's near where I live, and my uncle also got his degree from this university. I managed to maintain a GPA of 3.1 throughout here, and I try my best to either keep it or increase it. The work correlated to my major was very fun, but also very difficult, which is a reason that I'm proud of myself. One concern I do have for the future will be about the job that I'll have. Even if I do get a job in what I want, I do hope that I won't get tired of it.</p>
  <h2>Games</h2>
  <p>Some of my favorite game genres include Action or RPGs. Some games that I'm currently playing are Final Fantasy 14, Devil May Cry 5, Final Fantasy 15, and Monster Hunter World. Final Fantasy has become one of my favorite game series ever since I played Dissidia, and I am excited to play the 16th game when it gets ported to PC. As for some other series I enjoy, are Kingdom Hearts, Sonic, and Monster Hunter.</p>
